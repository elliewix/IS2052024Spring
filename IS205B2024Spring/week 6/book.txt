The quarter sovereign is a British gold coin issued by the Royal Mint since 2009.
It has been issued as a bullion coin and as a collector's coin.
The smallest in the sovereign range, it has a face value of 25 pence.
In 1853, the Royal Mint produced two patterns for a quarter sovereign for circulation, with one denominated as five shillings.
These coins never went into production.
In 1979, the Royal Mint began to sell sovereigns to those wishing to own gold coins, by the following year selling four different denominations, ranging from the half sovereign to the five pound gold coin.
